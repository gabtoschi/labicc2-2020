## Exercise 5
Exercise 5 was about create a circular doubly linked list to simulate a PC from Pok√©mon series, integrating with [these libraries made by the teacher](https://github.com/LeonardoTPereira/PokeCClone). The only files I actually coded were [`main.c`](../ex5/main.c), [`pokepc.h`](../ex5/pokepc.h) and [`pokepc.c`](../ex5/pokepc.c).
